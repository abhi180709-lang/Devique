# Technical Club Website

This project is a basic website created for a Technical Club. It includes the following pages:
- **Landing Page**
- **Members Page**
- **Events Page**

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap (20%)**

## Description
I built the website using pure HTML and CSS along with approximately 20% Bootstrap components for faster and responsive development.  
The navbar, hero section, features section, and footer were created using references from Bootstrap, while the remaining sections were designed manually.

## Features
- Responsive Navbar
- Hero Section
- Features Section
- Members Showcase
- Events Information Page

## Acknowledgements
